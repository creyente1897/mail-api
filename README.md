# Mail API

This is my first REST API made with nodejs . It is a simple Mail API that performs basic CRUD operations i.e Create, Read, Update and Delete .

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS
- Npm
- Postman - [Installing Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
- MongoDB - [Installing MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)

## Local Installation

Clone the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/creyente1897/mail-api.git
cd mail-api
```

Installing node modules (dependencies)

```sh
npm install
```

Running the project

```sh
node server/server.js
```

###### OR

You can also use nodemon

```sh
nodemon server/server.js
```

Now you can open the project on `localhost:3000`
